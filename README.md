# APT Fix Script for Kali Linux (WSL or Another)

This script is designed to reset APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) on Kali Linux, especially useful when facing issues with broken packages, locked files, or repository problems. It automates several tasks to clear cache, fix broken packages, remove locks, and update the package manager configuration.

## Features
- **Removes APT lock files**: Clears any APT process locks.
- **Reconfigures packages**: Reconfigures any packages that may be in a partially installed state.
- **Fixes broken packages**: Attempts to repair any broken dependencies.
- **Cleans and updates the APT cache**: Removes old files and updates the APT package lists.
- **Removes corrupted package lists**: Cleans up any corrupted APT list files.
- **Reinstalls base package management tools**: Reinstalls `dpkg` and `apt` to ensure they are not corrupted.
- **Imports missing GPG keys**: Ensures the GPG keys for the Kali Linux repositories are correctly imported.
- **Adjusts APT list permissions**: Fixes any incorrect file permissions that may prevent APT from functioning properly.

## Requirements
- Kali Linux (or a similar Debian-based distribution).
- Root (sudo) privileges.

## Usage

1. **Download the Script**:
   Clone or download this script to your machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diogolourencodev/fix-apt.git
   cd fix-apt
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Run the following command to make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x fix-apt.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script with root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo ./fix-apt.sh
   ```

   This will perform the following tasks:

   * Remove APT lock files
   * Reconfigure pending packages
   * Fix broken packages
   * Clean and update the APT cache
   * Remove corrupted package lists
   * Reinstall base package management tools
   * Update the system
   * Force missing package downloads
   * Import the GPG key for Kali Linux repositories
   * Adjust APT list permissions

## Troubleshooting

* If you encounter the error `Missing key for signature`, the script will automatically attempt to import the missing GPG key.
* If APT is still not functioning after running the script, check if your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file contains the correct repositories.
